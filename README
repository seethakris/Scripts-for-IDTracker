Scripts for analyzing trajectories.mat file from idTracker

1.Scripts that prepare files for analysis

	a. idTracker_modify_trajectories - On the first run, this script asks
		the user to enter the fish number as tracked for each group
		Group 1 - left hand side
		Group 2 - right hand side 
		It then looks for NaNs (when no fish was tracked) and jumps 
		(when fish was misidnetified) in the trajectories and 
		corrects them. The modified trajectories are then stored in a new 
		.mat file. If there is any error in fish numbers provided, 
		delete the mat file names FishNumber.mat and start over.  


	b. fix_trajectories - function called by  idTracker_modify_trajectories  
		to correct errors in the trajectories. 

2. Analyse trajectories

	a. idTracker_Heatmap (tbin, fps) - Draw heatmaps of the fish's mean trajectories using a user specified time bin. 
		Also saves heatmaps across the entire time period.User specifies time bin (tbin, in seconds) and sampling rate (fps) as input.
		Smoothing Factor and colormap scale can be changed in the beginning of the script itself.
		This script runs through the directory to look for any modified trajectory files so many experiments can be analyzed in one go.  


		
	b. subject_dist_from_grps(fps, TMin, TMax, tbin, y_thresh_min, y_thresh_max,Num_fish_close_to_subject)
		
		Calculates distance of subject fish from groups of fish. Plots some trajectories of fish within the defined ROI and saves values to excel. 

		This script requires a variety of inputs. If 0 inputs are given, default inputs are taken. use [] to use default inputs for some variable and user defined for others.
		
		eg usages; subject_dist_from_grps
			   subject_dist_from_grps(fps, TMin, TMax, tbin, y_thresh_min, y_thresh_max,Num_fish_close_to_subject)
			   subject_dist_from_grps(fps, [], [], tbin, y_thresh_min, y_thresh_max,Num_fish_close_to_subject)
			   subject_dist_from_grps(fps, TMin, TMax, tbin, [], [],Num_fish_close_to_subject)
			   etc	
		
		Inputs:
		fps - frames per second. Default : 30
  		TMin - Minimum time (seconds). Default : First Frame in video
  		TMax - Maximum time (seconds). Default : Last Frame in video
  		tbin - bin data over specified time bin (seconds). Default : All frames
  		y_thresh_min and y_thresh_max - ROI over which to analyze group behavior (in percent). Default : 0% (border closest to subject fish) to 25%
		Num_fish_close_to_subject - the least number of fish that need to be near the subject to include that frame. Default - 3
