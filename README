Scripts for analyzing trajectories.mat file from idTracker

1.Scripts that prepare files for analysis
	a. idTracker_modify_trajectories - On the first run, this script asks
		the user to enter the fish number as tracked for each group
		Group 1 - left hand side
		Group 2 - right hand side 
		It then looks for NaNs (when no fish was tracked) and jumps 
		(when fish was misidnetified) in the trajectories and 
		corrects them. The modified trajectories are then stored in a new 
		.mat file. If there is any error in fish numbers provided, 
		delete the mat file names FishNumber.mat and start over.  

	b. fix_trajectories - function called by  idTracker_modify_trajectories  
		to correct errors in the trajectories. 

2. Analyse trajectories
	a. idTracker_Heatmap (tbin, fps) - Draw heatmaps of the fish's mean trajectories 		using a user specified time bin. Also saves heatmaps across the entire 			time period.User specifies time bin (tbin, in seconds) and sampling rate 		(fps) as input.
		Radius for interpolation and colormap scale can be changed in the 			beginning of the script itself.
		This script runs through the directory to look for any modified trajectory 		files so many experiments can be analyzed in one go.  

	b. subject_dist_from_grps - Distance of subject fish from each group. Averaged
		across frames.
