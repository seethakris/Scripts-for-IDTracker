Scripts for analyzing trajectories.mat file from idTracker

1.Scripts that prepare files for analysis

	a. idTracker_modify_trajectories - On the first run, this script asks
		the user to enter the fish number as tracked for each group
		Group 1 - left hand side
		Group 2 - right hand side 
		It then looks for NaNs (when no fish was tracked) and jumps 
		(when fish was misidnetified) in the trajectories and 
		corrects them. The modified trajectories are then stored in a new 
		.mat file. If there is any error in fish numbers provided, 
		delete the mat file names FishNumber.mat and start over.  


	b. fix_trajectories - function called by  idTracker_modify_trajectories  
		to correct errors in the trajectories. 

2. Analyse trajectories

	a. idTracker_Heatmap (tbin, fps) - Draw heatmaps of the fish's mean trajectories using a user specified time bin. 
		Also saves heatmaps across the entire time period.User specifies time bin (tbin, in seconds) and sampling rate (fps) as input.
		Smoothing Factor and colormap scale can be changed in the beginning of the script itself.
		This script runs through the directory to look for any modified trajectory files so many experiments can be analyzed in one go.  


		
	b. subject_dist_from_grps(fps, TMin, TMax, tbin, y_thresh_min, y_thresh_max,Num_fish_close_to_subject,time_near)
		
		Calculates distance of subject fish from groups of fish. Plots some trajectories of fish within the defined ROI and saves values to excel. 

		This script requires a variety of inputs. If 0 inputs are given, default inputs are taken. use [] to use default inputs for some variable and user defined for others.
		
		eg usages; subject_dist_from_grps
			   subject_dist_from_grps(fps, TMin, TMax, tbin, y_thresh_min, y_thresh_max,Num_fish_close_to_subject,time_near)
			   subject_dist_from_grps(fps, [], [], tbin, y_thresh_min, y_thresh_max,Num_fish_close_to_subject,time_near)
			   subject_dist_from_grps(fps, TMin, TMax, tbin, [], [],Num_fish_close_to_subject,time_near)
			   etc	
		
		Inputs:
		fps - frames per second. Default : 30
  		TMin - Minimum time (seconds). Default : First Frame in video
  		TMax - Maximum time (seconds). Default : Last Frame in video
  		tbin - bin data over specified time bin (seconds). Default : All frames
  		y_thresh_min and y_thresh_max - ROI over which to analyze group behavior (in percent). Default : 0% (border closest to subject fish) to 25%
		Num_fish_close_to_subject - the least number of fish that need to be near the subject to include that frame. Default - 3
		time_near - time (seconds) to find stats on those frames where groups of fish were near the subject for the time specified. Default - 1 second
		
		Outputs in the excel file: separated for group1 vs group2 

		Group_frames : frame numbers where groups of fish were near the subject
		Group_centre_mass_mm : centre of mass (median of coordinates) of all the fish when that happened.
		Group_subjectdist_mm : distance of the position of the subject from this centre of mass
		Group1_and_group2_frames or Group2_and_group1_frames : Frames where Group1 and Group2 fish were both closer to subject are numbered 1 and otherwise 0. 
		Group_subject_quadrant : Frames are numbered according to where the subject was with respect to group1 fish. 
						1. closer to Group1
						2. closer to Group2
						3. farther from Group1
						4. farther from Group2


		Quadrant	: # of the quadrant
		Count_grp	: Number of frames where subject is in that quadrant
		Centremass_grp  : Mean centre of mass of groups when subject is in that quadrant
		Subdist_grp 	: Mean subject distance from group when subject is in that quadrant

		Group_time_secs : Start time of consecutive frames when group of fish were continuously near subject for time specified by user
		Group_time_centre_mass_mm : Mean centre of mass of groups in these frames
		Group_time_subjectdist_mm : Mean subject distance from group in these frames
		Group_time_subject_quadrant = Median quadrant over which subject exists in these frames
