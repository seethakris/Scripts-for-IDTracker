Scripts for analyzing trajectories.mat file from idTracker

1.Scripts that prepare files for analysis
	a. idTracker_modify_trajectories - On the first run, this script asks
		the user to enter the fish number as tracked for each group. 
		It then looks for NaNs (when no fish was tracked) and jumps 
		(when fish was misidnetified) in the trajectories and 
		corrects them. The modified trajectories are then stored in a new 
		.mat file. 

	b. fix_trajectories - function called by  idTracker_modify_trajectories  
		to correct errors in the trajectories. 

2. Analyse trajectories
	a. idTracker_Heatmap.m - Draw heatmaps of the fish's mean trajectories using
 		a user specified time bin.
	b. subject_dist_from_grps - Distance of subject fish from each group. Averaged
		across frames.
